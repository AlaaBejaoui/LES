# LES
This repository contains course materials from Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of Turbulent Flows. 

LES of Turbulent Flows is an advanced special topics graduate course taught at the University of Utah in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Students are generally from atmospheric sciences or engineering. The course was originally developed by Dr. Rob Stoll in 2009. 

These materials are adpted from Dr. Stoll's work and were expanded, updated, and amended with new content. I last taught the course using these materials in Fall 2016.
